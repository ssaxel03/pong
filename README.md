# Summary
<p>This local multiplayer Pong game, built in Unity as a learning project, lets two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, with points scored when the ball passes an opponent's paddle. Developed to understand Unity’s 2D physics and real-time input handling, it focuses on basics like object movement and collision detection.

While simple, the game provides hands-on experience with essential Unity features like scripting, physics, and UI setup. This project serves as a fun introduction to Unity’s capabilities, laying the foundation for more advanced development. </p>
